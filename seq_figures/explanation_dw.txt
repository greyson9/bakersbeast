This document explains how I processed the data to make the sequence-related figures, and
how to interpret each of the figures.

The first figure is a scatterplot comparing the fitness scores between two groups (exp1,
exp2, or control). These fitness scores are the ones calculated by the slope of the
regression line from aas.csv or codons.csv and are already normalized to wt growth rates.
Points lying on the diagonal show no difference in fitness between the two groups and
points far from the diagonal show a large difference.

The next figure is a histogram of the difference in fitness between the two groups.
Because the fitness scores were already normalized using a natural log in their 
calculation, to get a normal distribution here, we simply subtract the fitness score under
one condition from the fitness score under the other condition. We see a normal
distribution centered on approximately 0. I have overlaid a normal distribution with the
same mean and standard deviation over the histogram and marked 3 sd from the mean with
dotted lines.

Finally, I plotted the standard deviations from the mean of the difference in fitness
scores. For each mutant where mean is the average difference in fitness between the two
conditions and sd is the standard deviation of that calculation: ((e1-e0) - mean) / sd
When plotted, this shows us mutants who's fitness varies greatly between the two
conditions of interest.
